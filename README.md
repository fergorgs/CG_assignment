# CG_assignment
## Computer Graphics' assignment

These are three assignments made by me and my colleagues when taking computer graphics' classes.
They were made using python notebooks and the OpenGL libraries. All three can be run easily following
the "hot to run" file, inside each folder.

- T1: 2D scenario with basic controls and forms
- T2: 3D scenario with more complex movements, camera control and 3d models
- T3: same scenario from T2, but with lighting added.
